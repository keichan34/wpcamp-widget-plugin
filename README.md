# (Unofficial) WordCamp Widget Plugin

The companion widget to [The Unofficial WordCamp API](https://wpcamp-api.herokuapp.com).

## Warning

This widget is in a very early development stage. Widgets / features may change without warning.

# Hacking

You'll need Grunt to compile the admin-facing CoffeeScript. Besides that, this is a run-of-the-mill WordPress plugin. Pull requests are always welcome!
